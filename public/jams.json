Launching a community app also requires considering many factors including scalability, reliability, performance, and security, so we are excited for you to experience Wix Studio's built-in infrastructure and adaptability!Yes, you can submit multiple submissions to the prompt but you’ll need to publish a separate post for each submission.Yes, you can work on teams of up to four people.Participants need to be 18+ in order to participate.\nFor eligibility rules, see our \nofficial challenge rules\n.\nRiffing on open source code and borrowing and improving on previous work/ideas is encouraged but it’s important your changes are significant enough to ensure your submission is valid.It will depend, but transparency is important, license compatibility is important. You can use someone else’s code to give you a jumpstart to demonstrate your ideas on top of someone else’s base, but not just re-package the base.\nIt should be clear to the judges what you added to the project in terms of the code and conceptual inspiration. This means, you should clearly state what you were building on and what elements are original to this new submission.\nWhen building on existing code, we expect a significant change that adds something tangible to the output. i.e. a new animation, and new sprite, a new function, a new presentation. Not just changes to the source - i.e. changing colours, changing one sprite, changing one function.Anything deemed to be plagiarism will not be eligible for prizes. Incidental plagiarism may simply result in your disqualification from the challenge (regardless of the number of other valid submissions you have published). Egregious plagiarism will result in your suspension from DEV entirely. Any non-generic, non-trivial usage of prior work, including open source code must be credited in your submission.Non-english submissions are eligible for a completion badge but not eligible for prizes due to the current limitations of our judges. We will not be judging on mastery of the English language, so please don’t let this deter you from submitting if you are not a native English speaker! We hope to evolve this in the future to be more accommodating.\nYou are not required to license your code but we strongly recommend that you do. Here are some you may consider: \nMIT\n, \nApache\n, \nBSD-2\n, \nBSD-3\n, or \nCommons Clause\n.\nUse of AI is allowed as long as all other rules are followed. In fact, the Wix IDE offers a powerful AI assistant you can leverage.

    "description": "We're excited to announce the launch of our first-ever \nWeCoded Challenge\n—a new way to celebrate diversity, inclusion, and empowerment in the tech industry!\n\nSince 2018, DEV has celebrated International Women's Day with \nSheCoded\n, a call to action for the community to share powerful stories from women in tech about their journeys, challenges, and triumphs. What began as a platform for women's voices naturally evolved into \nWeCoded\n in 2023 —an inclusive space that amplifies \nall\n underrepresented and marginalized voices in our industry.\nThis evolution reflects our commitment to creating a community where everyone can see themselves represented, share their experiences, and find inspiration. WeCoded builds on the foundation of SheCoded while expanding our celebration to embrace the rich diversity of perspectives that make our community stronger.\nFor 2025, we're taking WeCoded to the next level by transforming it into a DEV Challenge format for the first time.\n We hope this allows even more community members to participate, whether by sharing personal stories \nor\n showcasing technical skills—creating more opportunities for voices to be heard and the overall importance of diversity and inclusion to be recognized.\n\nRunning through April 6\n, the \nWeCoded Challenge\n offers two distinct prompts for you to showcase your creativity, share your experiences, and see your work featured as part of our permanent celebration!\nAll winners will receive:\nThe winning design for our \nCelebrate in Code\n prompt will be used as the official WeCoded landing page after the challenge wraps!\nShare your personal journey or the stories you've witnessed in the tech industry—highlighting challenges, triumphs, and insights.

You can use someone else’s code to give you a jumpstart to demonstrate your ideas on top of someone else’s base, but not just re-package the base.\nIt should be clear to the judges what you added to the project in terms of the code and conceptual inspiration. This means, you should clearly state what you were building on and what elements are original to this new submission.\nWhen building on existing code, we expect a significant change that adds something tangible to the output. i.e. a new animation, and new sprite, a new function, a new presentation.

    "description": "We are thrilled to collaborate with the \nStellar Development Foundation\n to introduce the community to blockchain technology.\nRunning through \nAugust 18\n, the Build Better on Stellar: Smart Contract Challenge provides an opportunity for web devs to learn all about decentralization, wallets, consensus, interoperability, and all the other lingo you may have heard floating around but never quite understood. This is your signal to dive in and unlock those a-ha moments!\n\nWe have two prompts for this challenge, but six ways to win.\n\nDid we mention the $50,000 prize pool? And a free trip to London to attend the \nMeridian Conference\n?! Our biggest offering to-date, thanks to the generous Stellar Development Foundation.\n\nWe know it can be a bit intimidating to jump into web3 and blockchain, so the Stellar team has published \na companion guide\n that covers all the topics you need to get started.\nAdditionally, we encourage all participants to join the \ndev-hack\n channel in the \nStellar Dev Discord\n, a community server for asking questions and meeting the community of developers building with Stellar.\n\nStellar Livestreams\n\nThe Stellar team will host a series of livestreams right on DEV throughout the course of the challenge. Just visit \nour homepage\n at 12pm EDT on these dates:\nStellar empowers builders to unlock human and economic potential. It combines a powerful, decentralized blockchain network with a global ecosystem of innovators to create opportunities as borderless as ideas. It offers the tools to make a difference in the real world through new digital asset products and services that enhance access to the global financial system.Build a decentralized app (dApp) that leverages one or more Stellar smart contracts. The main requirement is that users should be able to interact with the application. Other than that, you are free to build whatever you want!In addition to our overall Build a dApp winner, we have two additional prize categories you could win for this prompt:\nOverall Build a dApp Winner\n\nGlorious Game and Super Sustainable Winners:\n\nNeed Inspiration?\nYour smart contract dApp could be related to:\nCreate a tutorial that explains some part of the Stellar developer experience.\nYour submission should be coherent and easy to follow. If you are creating a tutorial or walkthrough (written or video), the audience needs to be able to follow along. If you are writing code, it should be clear what the code is supposed to do. That said, we don't require submissions to be long/involved, or super polished. You don't need to be a professional writer to participate, and we want to reward efforts big and small.In addition to our overall Create a Tutorial winner, we have two additional prize categories you could win for this prompt:\nOverall Create a Tutorial Winner\n\nWonderfully Written and Vivid Video Winners:\n\nNeed Inspiration?\nYour tutorial could focus on:Yes, you are welcome to submit to multiple prompts.Yes, if your submission offers a solution to multiple prompts/prize categories, it can qualify for multiple prompts/prize categories.Yes, you can submit multiple submissions per prompt but you'll need to publish a separate post for each submission.Yes, you can work on teams of up to four people.Participants need to be 18+ in order to participate.\nFor eligibility rules, see our \nofficial challenge rules\n. Please also note that some DeFi protocols fall under regulatory scrutiny, so builders may want to consider building on testnet or gaining an understanding of any regulatory hurdles that they may encounter if they were to move to mainnet. (ex. many yield-bearing assets require US citizens to be accredited investors to use legally)\nRiffing on open source code and borrowing and improving on previous work/ideas is encouraged but it's important your changes are significant enough to ensure your submission is valid.It will depend, but transparency is important, license compatibility is important. You can use someone else's code to give you a jumpstart to demonstrate your ideas on top of someone else's base, but not just re-package the base.\nIt should be clear to the judges what you added to the project in terms of the code and conceptual inspiration. This means, you should clearly state what you were building on and what elements are original to this new submission.\nWhen building on existing code, we expect a significant change that adds something tangible to the output. i.e. a new animation, and new sprite, a new function, a new presentation. Not just changes to the source - i.e. changing colours, changing one sprite, changing one function.Anything deemed to be plagiarism will not be eligible for prizes. Incidental plagiarism may simply result in your disqualification from the challenge (regardless of the number of other valid submissions you have published). Egregious plagiarism will result in your suspension from DEV entirely. Any non-generic, non-trivial usage of prior work, including open source code must be credited in your submission.Non-english submissions are eligible for a completion badge but not eligible for prizes due to the current limitations of our judges. We will not be judging on mastery of the English language, so please don't let this deter you from submitting if you are not a native English speaker! We hope to evolve this in the future to be more accommodating.\nYou are not required to license your code but we strongly recommend that you do. Here are some you may consider: \nMIT\n, \nApache\n, \nBSD-2\n, \nBSD-3\n, or \nCommons Clause\n.\nUse of AI is allowed as long as all other rules are followed. We want to give you a chance to show off your skills in realistic scenarios. If you use AI tools to help you achieve your submission, all the power to you.\nOur editor supports many types of embeds, including: Stackblitz, Glitch, Github, etc. You can typically use the \n{% embed https://... %}\n syntax directly in the post. Click \nhere\n for more information on our markdown support.\nIn the event of a tie in scoring between judges, the judges will select the entry that received the highest number of positive reactions on their DEV post to determine the winner.Winners will be announced in a DEV post on the winner announcement date noted in our key dates section.The DEV Team will contact you via the email associated with your DEV profile within, at most, 10 business days of the announcement date to share the details of the shop gift.Both participation and winner badges will be awarded the same week as the winner announcement.When will I receive my prizes?\nThe DEV Team will contact you via the email associated with your DEV profile within, at most, 10 business days of the announcement date to share the details of claiming your prizes.The winner (including each member of a team) may be required to sign and return an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release, and provide any additional tax filing information (such as a W-9, social security number or Federal tax ID number) within seven (7) business days following the date of your first email notification.\nNO PURCHASE NECESSARY.

    "description": "Welcome to the Hot Wet Queer Summer Jam. We're trying something a little different with this jam. Itch.io is host to a wide variety of content, not just games. Over the past year I've seen a huge increase in self published authors moving to itch.io, especially as more readers get wind of this platform. Myself, and Jun, the creators of Monster Manor, aim to bring our community something new and different. An opportunity for authors to participate in a jam.  \n\n\nItch.io jams have primarily been host to competitions and challenges to create different kinds of games. If you're unfamiliar, these sort of work like NaNoWriMo worked for authors, but with games. You can browse itch.io's jams and jam calendar \nhere\n if want to poke around and get an idea for how they work. Make sure to check out the community page of this jam! \n\n\nWhat makes this jam different is this jam is hosted specifically with authors and readers in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a \nthemed jam\n meaning all submissions will be required to fit within the theme. \n\nTHE THEME IS \n\nHot Wet Queer Summer\n\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, the interpretation is up to you! This jam is open to all works that fit under the lgbtqi2s+ umbrella. You do not have to specify whether you as an author or just the characters in your story are queer. We also do not require your work to have romance in it, or explicitly state a gender identity or sexuality. This will work on the honor system! All your story has to be is \nwet \nand \nhot\n. A few examples of this are wet hot settings like a tropical area, or a sauna. Perhaps the content is wet and hot, or even your story features a sopping wet 300 degree monster. It's up to you \nas long as it's wet, hot, and queer. \n\n\nSome further guidelines\n\n♡ This jam is for eBooks specifically. Comics and other written material are also acceptable, but this jam is not intended for game submissions including visual novels. \n\n♡ Original works only, please do not submit fanfiction\n\n♡ Submitted works can be any length, from short stories to full novels. There are no word count minimums or maximums.\n\n♡ This jam officially runs from June 1st to August 31st, submissions \nmust be created during this time. \nYou can outline, plan, character create or draft however you need to prior to the summer but the final product should be made during this time period. This isn't something I will be strict about but it's more fun if you play along, it's supposed to be a challenge. \n\n♡ There are no genre or content requirements outside of the theme. All submissions will be accepted, as long as they do not violate the itch.io terms of service, are your own original work, and fit the theme, but we \ndo ask\n that you properly tag your work with content warnings. \n\n♡ Absolutely no AI may be used for any part of your work. I will know, and I will be a nightmare about it. \n\n♡ You MUST credit anyone who worked on your book with you in the front matter, including cover artist and editor. Ideally these would also be listed on your project page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started on itch.io as an author\n\nIf you're completely new to itch.io but would like to participate author \nRien Gray\n has an extremely comprehensive and easy to follow to guide posted on their \nmedium\n. This guide is what I used to help me get started as well as many of my peers. If you appreciate this guide consider supporting them in some way, either by purchasing their work our following Rien on their \nitch.io\n.\n\n\nIf you have further questions that this guide or itch.io's own FAQ doesn't resolve for you, feel free to shoot me an e-mail at hswolfewriiting@gmail.com\n\n\nFree assets for writing and cover design\n\nIf you're looking for a free program to write in that isn't google docs check out \nEllipsus\n which promises to never use AI. \nReedsy\n is another online writing program where you're also able to plot, write, and format ebooks free of charge. If you're able to though, many authors use \nAtticus\n which is a one time payment for a fairly simple program that allows you to format ebooks, PDFs and paperbacks. \n\nFor covers many authors are able to make pretty cool designs in \nCanva\n but you have to be careful with this, as canva now boasts quite a few AI features. Though it is possible to use this program without AI. For free assets for internal art, and covers, both \nPexels\n and \nUnsplash\n have free photo resources. You can also find Creative Commons (or public domain) artwork on most museum websites or websites like \nArtvee\n. \n\n\nIf you're looking for help with a cover or formatting we have partnered with several creators you can find below\n\n\n♡ Jun T.N - Covers, headers, and formatting\n\n♡ Yune - Illustrated Covers\n\n♡ \n\nAiric Fenn\n - \nIllustrated Covers, headers, spot illustrations\n\n♡ V - Cover and insert art\n\n♡ Vert - Editing and formatting\n\n♡ Kal Morgan - Copy Editing\n\n♡ Geetha Krishnan - Editing\n\n♡ Dae Storm - Cover Art\n\n♡ Larkin Bryne - Editing",
